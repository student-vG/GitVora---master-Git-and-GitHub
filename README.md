## 🧪 Run Locally

1. Open folder in VS Code
2. Use Live Server (or any static server)
3. Open `index.html`

---

## 🛡️ Safe Force Push Note

Use this only after history rewrite (rebase/squash) on your own branch:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>
```

Prefer `--force-with-lease` over `--force` to avoid overwriting teammates' remote work.

Made for developers who want to master Git and GitHub with confidence.
